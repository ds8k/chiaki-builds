# (Unofficial) Chiaki builds

[![Build Release](https://github.com/alvaromunoz/chiaki-builds/actions/workflows/Build-win_x64.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alvaromunoz/chiaki-builds/actions/workflows/Build-win_x64.yml)

This is just a repo with [Chiaki](https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki) as a
Git submodule, automating the build scripts on GitHub Actions Workflows.

So far only Windows x64 builds have been automated, using both MSYS2 and Visual Studio.

If you want to download the official releases, please check out the original repo:

## Why?

[Because](https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki/tree/master/doc/platform-build.md):

> Windows support is reduced to the absolute minimum for maintainability.

SDL2 has not been updated from 2.0.10 (2.0.14 introduced support for Dualsense
controllers in Windows), and the binary release has a problem with blinking
frames. It seems that building using updated libraries and software fixes
these issues, so I wanted to automate this to be as open as possible.

### What's updated by new libraries?

- Support for PlayStation Dualsense and XBox Series S|X controllers
- Hardware video acceleration for decoding

### What's not updated?

- Choppy audio (YMMV)

### What's missing (but from the official release, too)?

- Motion controls
